# Maze Solver

Welcome to the Maze Solver project repository! This project is all about navigating mazes comparing a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent with the classic A* algorithm.

## Project Purpose

The main goal of this project is to explore and compare different approaches to solve mazes. I've implemented both an RL agent and the A* algorithm to see which one performs better in finding the optimal path through various mazes.

## Techniques Implemented

- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** We've trained an RL agent to learn how to navigate through mazes by exploring different paths, receiving rewards, and updating its strategy over time.

- **A* Search Algorithm:** The classic A* algorithm, known for its efficiency and optimality, has been implemented to solve mazes. It cleverly combines heuristic estimation and intelligent search to find the shortest path from start to goal.

## Results
Even if they often make different paths, if trained enough, the RL and A* agents complete the maze with the same number of steps
